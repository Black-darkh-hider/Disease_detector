# 🩺 Disease Detector – Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Overview

The **Disease Detector** is a machine learning project designed to **predict diseases** based on patient health data.
Using classification algorithms, the model analyzes **symptoms and medical attributes** to provide predictions that can assist in healthcare diagnostics.

This project is implemented in **Python** with **Jupyter Notebook** and leverages popular ML libraries for **training, evaluation, and deployment**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Data preprocessing & cleaning for health-related datasets
* ✅ Train ML models for disease prediction
* ✅ Model evaluation with accuracy, classification report & confusion matrix
* ✅ Save trained model (`.pkl`) for reuse
* ✅ Easy-to-use interface via **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Create a project folder and move into it
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies using:


---

## ▶️ Usage

### Run in Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

1. Open **Disease\_Detector.ipynb**
2. Run the notebook step by step
3. Train the model and generate predictions
4. (Optional) Use the saved model (`.pkl`) for deployment in other apps

---

## 📊 Example Workflow

* Load dataset
* Preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categorical features, scale numerics)
* Train ML model (Random Forest / Logistic Regression / etc.)
* Evaluate model using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix
* Save trained model for later usage

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* 🌐 Build a **Streamlit Web App** for user-friendly interaction
* 📈 Expand dataset for **multiple disease categories**
* 🤖 Add **Deep Learning models** for better accuracy
* ☁️ Deploy on **Cloud (AWS / GCP / Heroku)**
